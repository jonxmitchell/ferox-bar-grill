# Testing

In this file, you will see the documentation that I have put together throughout the time of creating this website. This will go over any errors that were encourted if any and also checking to ensure that the code valid by running it through code validators.

## Code Validation

This section will show how well the code has performed within code validators.

### HTML

I have decided to use the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check if my HTML code is valid. Please see the below table with the results.

## Browser Compatibility

Here I have chosen to test how the site works across 4 of the biggest browsers available. As I do not have access to a MacBook or a device that can run the latest version of Apple's Safari browser, I am unable to test the site on that browser. The site has been tested on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Opera and Firefox.
