### Home Page Feature

The home page is the very first page that anyone will most likely land on. The purpose of this feature is to explain what the site is. You can use the navigation links to navigate the site as well as clear images and visible text and a button on the top half of the page to book a table. This page also shows some reviews of past customers.

The menu page is a great future of the website as the customers can see what food is being served. The menu is shown in categories which customers can click open to expand, this was chosen to work like this to keep the page nice and clean and free from clutter and showing only the information the customer wants.
